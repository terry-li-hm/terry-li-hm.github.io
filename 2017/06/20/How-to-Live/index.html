<blockquote>
<p>人生、職場、愛情之所以會卡關，常常是我們的內心卡住了！有些人堅持，一定要先看到「前面路口都全是綠燈，我才要踩油門」，一定要先確保我的投入會有收益，我才要認真付出。我想說的是，這世界不是個「釣蝦場」，會有專人在池子裡倒蝦，釣不到還保證獲得一斤！這個世界是個叢林，就算你威猛如老虎，也只有5%-10%的捕獵成功率，那該怎麼辦？沒怎麼辦啊～就努力嘗試狩獵，失敗就再試一次，試了20次也許有機會獵到一隻兔子，但你的狩獵技術也會提高，也許未來只要嘗試15次就可以補到。你雖然辛苦，但你擁有自由，而且終會成為優秀的野生老虎。某天一位朋友告訴你，有個地方完全不用打獵，只要能跳過火圈，就「保證」有肉可以吃，你會想要制止他，因為你知道「保證回報」的背後多半是個牢籠！</p>
<p>講到這裡，我想我們可以為「成熟大人」多加一項定義：就是認清現實，瞭解世上沒有什麼是能「保證回報」的。想獲得理想的人生，不是到處尋找絕對有效的秘方，而是先虔誠地「獻祭」必要的代價，持續累積，相信最終在某個時間點會有想像不到的結局！</p>

<p>It is important to understand that the outcome of empirical research using statistical hypothesis testing is never proof. It can only support a hypothesis, reject it, or do neither. These methods yield only probabilities.</p>
<p>Among scientific researchers, empirical evidence (as distinct from empirical research) refers to objective evidence that appears the same regardless of the observer. For example, a thermometer will not display different temperatures for each individual who observes it. Temperature, as measured by an accurate, well calibrated thermometer, is empirical evidence. By contrast, non-empirical evidence is subjective, depending on the observer. Following the previous example, observer A might truthfully report that a room is warm, while observer B might truthfully report that the same room is cool, though both observe the same reading on the thermometer. The use of empirical evidence negates this effect of personal (i.e., subjective) experience or time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Motivation to commit scientific misconduct<br>According to David Goodstein of Caltech, there are motivators for scientists to commit misconduct, which are briefly summarised here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Career pressure<br>Science is still a very strongly career-driven discipline. Scientists depend on a good reputation to receive ongoing support and funding, and a good reputation relies largely on the publication of high-profile scientific papers. Hence, there is a strong imperative to “publish or perish”. Clearly, this may motivate desperate (or fame-hungry) scientists to fabricate results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ease of fabrication<br>In many scientific fields, results are often difficult to reproduce accurately, being obscured by noise, artifacts, and other extraneous data. That means that even if a scientist does falsify data, they can expect to get away with it – or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field. There are no “scientific police” who are trained to fight scientific crimes; all investigations are made by experts in science but amateurs in dealing with criminals. It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[H]ow many times have you been told to “think positively” in order to reach your goals? It’s probably the most popular piece of personal guidance, beloved by everyone from high school teachers to best-selling careers experts. One key idea behind the slogan is that if you visualise your ideal future, you’re more likely to get there.</p>
<p>The problem? Evidence suggests that the opposite is true. Recent research found evidence that fantasising about your perfect life actually makes you less likely to make it happen. While it can be pleasant, it reduces motivation because it makes you feel that you’ve already hit those targets.<sub><a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/#fn-1" target="_blank" rel="external">1</a></sub> We’ll cover some ways positive thinking can be helpful later in the article.</p>

<p>Mental health is not our area of expertise, and we can’t offer medical advice. We’d recommend seeing a doctor as your first step. If you’re at university, there should be free services available.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you might like to look into the latest evidence-based treatments yourself. For instance, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has also been found to help with many mental health problems, and is increasingly available online. One resource to check out is <a href="https://golantern.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Go Lantern</a>. A classic book is <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336" target="_blank" rel="external">Feeling Good</a></em> by David Burns – reading the book has even been tested in rigorous (randomised controlled) trials and found to reduce the symptoms of depression.</p>

<p>We must be careful, too, to avoid sham options, which exist only to make the “real” option look better. More than a few real estate agents, for instance, have admitted to taking their clients to lousy properties first to make the subsequent visits more appealing.</p>
<p>This sham-option technique is used frequently in politics, where bosses demand choices but aren’t always careful to assess the quality of the options. For insight on this subject, we turn to a formidable practitioner of the art of manipulation, former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>In his memoir While House Years, he discusses a classic bureaucratic trick that was played on President Richard Nixon, who was considering what policy to adopt on a particular issue in Europe. The State Department presented a memo to Nixon with three “options.” Kissinger noted that two options were obvious losers, leaving only one plausible choice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here was the standard bureaucratic device of leaving the decision-maker with only one real option, which for easy identification is placed in the middle. The classic case, I joked, would be to confront the policy maker with the choices of nuclear war, present policy, or surrender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To diagnose whether your colleagues have created real or sham options, poll them for their preferences. If there’s disagreement, that’s great sign that you have real options.</p>

<p>有位老爺爺家門前有個很大的庭院，常常有小朋友跑來玩耍喧鬧，怎麼樣都趕不走。於是老爺爺想到一個妙招，他先把帶頭的小孩叫來，跟他說：「我很喜歡熱鬧，你去多找幾個小孩子來玩，每個人我打賞100塊！」果然來了一群孩子，老爺爺也如實發給「工資」。孩子個個歡欣鼓舞，加倍喧嘩。就這樣過了一個禮拜，老爺爺說，我錢不夠了，現在每個人只能給10塊，於是很多孩子很失望，人就漸漸少了。最後老爺爺跟剩下的人說，不好意思，我沒辦法再付錢給你們了，只好請你們免費服務。結果這群孩子包含一開始帶頭的，都非常氣憤：「去！連10塊錢都沒有，我們還來幹嘛，走了走了…」於是大家一哄而散，留下一個寧靜的庭院，老爺爺露出了微笑。馴化成功！</p>

<h2 id="Confirmation-Bias"><a href="#Confirmation-Bias" class="headerlink" title="Confirmation Bias"></a>Confirmation Bias</h2><p>According to Wikipedia, confirmation bias “is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirm one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning.”</p>
<h3 id="From-top-Chasing-Carrots-Healing-Self-Help-Deceptions-With-a-Scientific-Philosophy-of-Life"><a href="#From-top-Chasing-Carrots-Healing-Self-Help-Deceptions-With-a-Scientific-Philosophy-of-Life" class="headerlink" title="From top Chasing Carrots: Healing Self-Help Deceptions With a Scientific Philosophy of Life:"></a>From top Chasing Carrots: Healing Self-Help Deceptions With a Scientific Philosophy of Life:</h3><p>Confirmation bias means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We interpret information in a way that confirms the theories, ideologies, and convictions we already believe in  - we see what we want to see.</p>
<p>In his book The Art of Thinking Clearly, Rolf Dobelli describes an experiment that explains the problem with the confirmation bias:</p>
<p>A professor wrote down the numbers 2, 4, and 6. He then asked his students to find the rule he used to come up with this line of numbers of proposing more number that would fit the rule. Naturally, the students started with 8. The professor answered that 8 fitted the rule. The students continued with 10, 12, and 14, with the professor always responding that these numbers fit the rule.</p>
<p>Now the students tried to solve the questions. They said, “The rule is: add 2 to the previous number.” It’s very likely, you agree with their solution right?</p>
<p>The professor, however, shook his head. He said, “No. That is not the rule.” The students were stunned.</p>
<p>Then one student said, “1?” The professor answered, “Doesn’t fit the rule.” “9?” “Fits the rule.” The student continued with 59, -19, 30, 0, and so on. After a while, he said, “The rule is: every number has to be higher than the previous number.”</p>
<p>The professor nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The student was able to see the obvious point his fellow students had missed because he attacked the problem with a different way of thinking. Instead of trying to prove his idea right, he wanted to prove it wrong - he wanted to find <em>disconfirming evidence</em>. Only after he failed to falsify his theory, he accepted the logical conclusion that it must be true, avoiding the confirmation bias and finding the truth. The other students fell for the confirmation bias because they tried to prove their idea right. They neglected to ask on of the many numbers that could have disproved they theory; they only tried a few examples that fit it. When there was no immediate reason to discard their theory, they accepted it as the truth - and were wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that this may not be an example of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>Whenever you think you found an answer, try to prove it wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We recommend saving enough money that you could comfortably live for at least six months if you had no income, and ideally twelve. Firstly, because it gives you security. Secondly, because it gives you the flexibility to make big career changes and take risks. Exactly how much to hold depends on how easily you could find another job. (<a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-everyone-even-our-readers-should-save-enough-to-live-for-6-24-months/" target="_blank" rel="external">Read more</a> about how much runway you need.) The standard advice is also to save about 15% of your income for retirement.</p>
<p>So how can you go about saving money?</p>
<ul>
<li>Save automatically. Set up a direct debit from your main account to a savings account, so you never notice the money.</li>
<li>Focus on big wins. Rather than constantly scrimping (don’t buy that latte!), identify one of two areas of your budget you could cut that will have a big effect. Often cutting rent by moving somewhere smaller or sharing a house with someone else is the biggest thing.</li>
<li>But beware of swapping money for time. Suppose you could save /$100 per month by moving somewhere with an hour longer commute. Instead, maybe you could spend that time working overtime, making you more likely to get promoted, or earning extra wages. You’d only need to earn /$5/hour to break even with the more expensive rent.</li>
<li>Until you have six months’ runway, cut your donations back to 1%.</li>
<li>For more tips, check out <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mr Money Mustache</a> and Ramit Sethi’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich/dp/0761147489" target="_blank" rel="external">I Will Teach You to be Rich</a>. Unfortunately, the tone of these is not for everyone, but they have the best tips we’re aware of.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that it might be more effective to focus on earning more rather than spending less, especially through <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-get-a-job/#stage-3-negotiation" target="_blank" rel="external">negotiating your salary</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’re saving 15% and have at least 6-12 months’ runway, move on to the next step.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the study, participants acted as the seller in the role-played negotiation over an iPod. As sellers, they knew everything about the iPod: It was relatively new, had a spiffy cover, and was filled with an impressive collection of songs. On the other hand, it had frozen up twice in the past, forcing a reset that resulted in all the music being deleted.</p>
<p>The researches wondered what it would take for the sellers to disclose the freezing problem. The buyers in the negotiation, who were cronies of the researchers, tried three different strategies. When the buyers asked about the iPod, “What can you tell me about it?,” only 8% of the sellers disclosed the problem. The question “It does’t have any problem, does it?” boosted the disclosure to 61%.</p>
<p>The best question to ask, in hope of discovering the truth, was this one “What problems does it have?” That prompted 89% of the sellers to come clean.</p>
<p>The researchers explain that probing questions signal confidence and experience in the asker. The seller knows she isn’t likely to pull one over on your. There’s a similar signaling effect with Judge Schiltz’s questions “How many associates were hired give years ago?” and “How many of those associates remain at the firm?”</p>
<p><strong>THIS PRACTICE OF ASKING</strong> probing questions is useful when you are trying to pry information from people who have an incentive to spin you: salesmen, recruiters, employees with agendas, and so on. On the other hand, it can backfire in situations where there’s a clear power dynamic, as between a doctor and a patient. Here’s why: Tough questions work in the iPod situation because they signal confidence and experience in the asker, but when the asker is already the clear “expert,” as the doctor is in the doctor/patient situation, then asking aggressive questions will only reinforce the doctor’s dominance. That can cause patients to clam up or to follow the doctor’s lead too eagerly, even if it isn’t the most productive direction.</p>
<p>So for doctors to gather trustworthy information, they’ve got to be diligent about asking open-ended questions - much more like the generic iPod question, “What can you tell me about it?” That kind of question was ineffective in the iPod situation, but it works wonders with patients.</p>
<p>How do you know whether to ask probing questions or open-ended ones? A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, “What’s the most likely way I could fail to get the right information in this situation?” Generally, it will be obvious what the answer is: If you’re buying a used car, you’re most likely to fail by not discovering a flaw of the vehicle, or if you’re a vic president seeking feedback from factory workers, you’re most likely to fail by not uncovering what they really think. You can tailor your questions accordingly - more aggressive in the used-car negotiations and more open-ended with the factory worker.</p>

<ul>
<li>life circumstances: around 10%</li>
<li>genetics: around 50%</li>
<li>behavior &amp; thoughts: around 40%<br>(which research supports this?)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply put, money doesn’t make us happy. Only a total lack of money can make us unhappy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author argues that this applies to other life circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A house or an apartment can make us as happy as a mansion. We become unhappy when we are unable to afford our own place at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he doesn’t cite any research. But it seems in line with what 80,000 hours said and what the author of How Will You Measure Your Life? said about hygienic factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond a certain point, increasing our life circumstances is a waste of time and effort. We have to reach a certain minimum in all aspects but we don’t have to lead the world in anything to be happy. While most of us think that better life circumstances will bring us a lot of happiness over a long period, they will only bring us a little happiness over a short period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again is there any research backing this up? If not it is just a personal experience. Although I agree with it, try to seek for the research. Beware of the confirmation bias Terry!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1940s, many households had no running water, no indoor toilets, and no electricity. They had no internet, no iPhones, no flat screen TVs, and no high-tech cars; plus there was a World War, and millions of people died on the battlefields. Since then, our life situation has improved drastically, but our happiness has not. Polls show that people in the U.S. ranked themselves happier in the 1940s than they do now. Apparently, life circumstances are not all that important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, which research the author refers to? And better study the research carefully to see if there is any logical error. And even it is accurate can the reason be that something bad happen recently (like 9-11)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We overestimate how much and how long life circumstances will make us happy.</p>
<p>We adjust to better life situations and our happiness returns to it baseline.</p>
<p>Psychologists call this mechanism hedonic adaptation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marriage increase happiness level, but only for two years.</li>
<li>The birth of a child increases happiness levels, but only for one year.</li>
<li>Winning the lottery increases happiness, but only for six months.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Where are the research?</p>
<p>Implication:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We know that anything we buy will increase our happiness only briefly. Therefore, we can stop buying more and more things in an attempt to extend the happiness boost. We can learn to be content with what we have, knowing that these things are perfectly fine, even if their happiness boost is gone.</li>
<li>Since we can realistically expect how little changing life circumstances will increase our long-term happiness, we can avoid spending too much money on what we hope can make us happy. There is no need to get into debt for a new car that will only make us happy for a few months if we must then pay off the debt by working for years in a job we hate. We can anticipate that the overall result of this equation is negative and that our new car will reduce our happiness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So we should go for it if the overall result of this equation is positive right?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We know that there is nothing wrong with us when the happiness of a new relationship, a new job, or something we bought wears off quickly. This process is perfectly normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>We underestimate our power to cope with negative situations</p>
<p>Statistics about paralyzed people, however, show that they are just as happy as the average people - this even applies to people who are completely paralyzed having to communicate by meticulously spelling out every word through a computer controlled by their minds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where is the statistics?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Breakups and divorces make us unhappy, but only for six months.</li>
<li>After their accident, paraplegics feel unhappy, but no longer than a year.</li>
<li>In a German study, participants rated their current and overall happiness once a year for 17 years. The study found that only 25 percent of all people reported a change in happiness, while only 10 percent reporting a significant change. In the long run, the happiness of all participant remained at its baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>… once your control for aptitude, a person’s lifetime earnings don’t vary based on what college they attended.</p>
<p>In early 1990s, Shane Frederick, then a graduate student, was shopping for a stereo in Vancouver, and he found himself “frozen in indecision” between a $1,000 Pioneer and a $700 Sony. He ended up spending almost an hour agonizing over the decision until finally a salesman approached him and asked a question: “Well, think of it this way - would you rather have the Pioneer or the Sony and $300 worth of albums?” That question broke Frederick’s mental logjam; he decided to buy the Sony. The extra features of the Pioneer were cool, he figured, but not nearly as cool as a bunch of new music.</p>

<p>Multitracking keeps egos in check. If your boss has three pet projects in play, chances are she’ll be open to unvarnished feedback about them, but if there’s only one pet project, it will be harder for her to hear the truth. Her ego will be perfectly conflated with the project.</p>

<p>“I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what this decision is about.”</p>
<p>Let’s stop arguing about who is right, he said. Instead, let’s take each option, one at a time, and ask ourselves: What would have to be true for this option to be the right answer?</p>
<p>What if our least favorite option were actually the best one? What data might convince us of that?</p>
<p>In some organizations, hiring managers have become smarter about reference calls. Some ask the references for additional people to contact who weren’t on the original list.</p>
<p>In the study, participants acted as the seller in the role-played negotiation over an iPod. As sellers, they knew everything about the iPod: It was relatively new, had a spiffy cover, and was filled with an impressive collection of songs. On the other hand, it had frozen up twice in the past, forcing a reset that resulted in all the music being deleted.</p>
<p>The researches wondered what it would take for the sellers to disclose the freezing problem. The buyers in the negotiation, who were cronies of the researchers, tried three different strategies. When the buyers asked about the iPod, “What can you tell me about it?,” only 8% of the sellers disclosed the problem. The question “It does’t have any problem, does it?” boosted the disclosure to 61%.</p>
<p>The best question to ask, in hope of discovering the truth, was this one “What problems does it have?” That prompted 89% of the sellers to come clean.</p>
<p>The researchers explain that probing questions signal confidence and experience in the asker. The seller knows she isn’t likely to pull one over on your. There’s a similar signaling effect with Judge Schiltz’s questions “How many associates were hired give years ago?” and “How many of those associates remain at the firm?”</p>
<p><strong>THIS PRACTICE OF ASKING</strong> probing questions is useful when you are trying to pry information from people who have an incentive to spin you: salesmen, recruiters, employees with agendas, and so on. On the other hand, it can backfire in situations where there’s a clear power dynamic, as between a doctor and a patient. Here’s why: Tough questions work in the iPod situation because they signal confidence and experience in the asker, but when the asker is already the clear “expert,” as the doctor is in the doctor/patient situation, then asking aggressive questions will only reinforce the doctor’s dominance. That can cause patients to clam up or to follow the doctor’s lead too eagerly, even if it isn’t the most productive direction.</p>
<p>So for doctors to gather trustworthy information, they’ve got to be diligent about asking open-ended questions - much more like the generic iPod question, “What can you tell me about it?” That kind of question was ineffective in the iPod situation, but it works wonders with patients.</p>
<p>How do you know whether to ask probing questions or open-ended ones? A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, “What’s the most likely way I could fail to get the right information in this situation?” Generally, it will be obvious what the answer is: If you’re buying a used car, you’re most likely to fail by not discovering a flaw of the vehicle, or if you’re a vic president seeking feedback from factory workers, you’re most likely to fail by not uncovering what they really think. You can tailor your questions accordingly - more aggressive in the used-car negotiations and more open-ended with the factory worker.</p>
<p>When we want something to be true, we gather information that supports our desire. But the confirmation bias doesn’t just affect what information people go looking for; it even affects what they notice in the first place. Think of a couple in a troubled marriage: If one partner has labeled the other’s shortcoming - for instance, being “selfish” - then that label can become self-reinforcing. The selfish acts become easier to spot, while the generous acts go unnoticed.</p>
<p>In situations like this, the therapist Aaron T. Beck, the found of cognitive behavioral therapy, advises that couples consciously fight the tendency to notice only what’s wrong. To avoid that trap, he advises couples to keep “marriage diaries,” chronicling the tings their mates do that please them.</p>
<p>In this book <em>Love Is Never Enough</em>, he describes a couple, Karen and Ted, who kept such a diary. One week, Karen noted several things that she appreciated about Ted: <em>He Sympathized with me about some bad behavior by one of my clients. He pitched in to help clean up the house. He Kept me company while I was doing laundry. He suggested we go for a walk, which I enjoyed.</em></p>
<p>Beck said, “Although Ted had done similar things for Karen in the past, they had been erased from her memory because of her negative view of Ted.” The same effect held true for Ted’s memory of the nice things Karen had done.</p>
<p>Beck cities a research study by Mark Kane Goldstein, who found that 70% of couples who kept this kind of marriage diary reported an improvements in their relationship. “All that had changed was their awareness of what was going on,” Beck wrote. “Before keeping track, they had underestimated the pleasures of their marriage.”</p>

<p>It works much better if I start out by agreeing: “Yep. Plan Z is a reasonable plan. Not only for the reasons you mentioned, but here are two more advantages. And Plan A - the plan that we chose - not only has the flaws that you mentioned, but here are three more flaws.” The effect of this technique is amazing. It seems completely counterintuitive, but even if you don’t convince people that your plan is better, hearing you explain your plan’s flaws - and their plan’s advantages - makes them much more comfortable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this free from a publisher who wanted me to use it in my class. I applaud the attempt to use actual science in the oversaturated self-help happiness market. Its nice to see somebody with qualifications who actually does research on the topic writing this sort of thing. And as that genre of books go, its probably well above its peers. But I do empirical psychology for a living, and so I couldn’t read it without getting into “reviewer mode”. And let me tell you, there are a lot of things in this book that I think need revise and resubmit…</p>
<p>For example, the author notes the fact that only 10% of variance in happiness ratings is due to a person’s situation (as opposed to behaviors or genetics). Sadly, she then conflates that with the notion that only 10% of a person’s subjective happiness is due to a person’s situation. The first is a population heritability estimate, the latter looks at individuals. This fundamental mischaracterization of the statistic undermines her entire point.</p>
<p>She also neglects the possibility of interaction terms between situation and behaviors. Yes, its true that interacting with friends is a behavioral variable so gets counted under behavior in her model, but its harder for people living alone in a research station in siberia to interact with friends than folks living in the town they grew up in, so situation (location) needs to be counted in this.</p>
<p>All in all, a sloppy book from a scientific perspective. I stopped reading around chapter 3 because it was pissing me off.</p>

<p>The lower slice of the pie shows that an astounding 50 percent of the differences among people’s happiness levels can be accounted for by their genetically determined set points. This discovery comes from the growing research done with identical and fraternal twins that suggests that each of us is born with a particular happiness set point that originates from our biological mother or father or both, a baseline or potential for happiness to which we are bound to return, even after major setbacks or triumphs.</p>

<li>「盈利管理」技巧</li>
<li>根據會計準則，股份回購時出現任何盈虧一律不會影響損益表，因公司與股東被視為一體，公司向股東回購股份，會計上只是「左手交右手」，只有在股東權益變動表才能看出端倪。</li>
<li>企業回購股票不等於一定是「盈利管理」，每當上市公司宣佈回購股票，市場多視為好消息利好股價。如早前公佈2016年中期業績的滙豐控股(005)，儘管上半年除稅前利潤(以列帳基準計)大跌28.7%至97.14億(美元，下同)，即使撇除特殊重大項目，經調整除稅前利潤仍減14%至107.95億元，但管理層決定動用25億元回購股份，消息一出即令股價一洗頹風。業績公佈前一個交易日，滙控收報50.8港元，執筆時(本月11日)收報54.4港元，加上約0.775港元中期股息，累升近9%。其實，滙控這次回購規模不算大，按本月9日收報54.35港元計，25億元約可回購3.59億股普通股，以當日已發行股數199.24億股計，可回購股數隻相當於總股數約1.8%，而且對每股盈利正面影響有限，如今年上半年每股盈利0.32元，股數減1.8%後，只升至0.33元。回購那麼少，對每股盈利影響也甚輕微，但卻大幅推高股價，看來這25億元使得物有所值。</li>
<li>值得留意，回購將降低資本充足比率，對銀行來說並不是好事。但回購規模細，影響非常有限。此外，回購的股票將以庫存方式持有，即是將買回來的股票存放在公司而非註銷，這些股票既沒有投票權，也不享有股息，故能減少市場上的股票數目，亦可提高每股盈利和股息。以庫存方式持有的好處是具彈性，當需要資金時，只要將庫存股向市場出售就可套現，而且又可留起來作其他用途，如員工股權激勵計畫。</li>

<ul>
<li>有人翻譯成「洗大澡」或「巨額沖銷」</li>
<li>將所有不好的東西全放在同一年的業績中，重點是要一次過「曬冷」，千萬不要「唧牙膏」。例如某公司今年業績錄得虧損，消息公佈後股價必然大跌。不過，無論公司蝕100萬元還是1000萬元，股價一樣都會下跌。既然如此，就儘量將今年的虧損擴大。最重要的是，由於今年的數值將會用來衡量明年的業績，今年愈差代表明年的基數愈低，即使明年只有寸進甚或原地踏步，但因為基數低的關係，就能夠造成明年轉好或大升的假象。等等，不是有會計準則的嗎？的確有的，但準則或多或少都具有一定彈性，而且在不少情況下，例如是企業重組和出售不良資產等，都需依賴企業管理層去估算，因此造就空間去做Big bath。</li>

<p>最乾脆的做法是把子公司賣掉。當然，價錢賣得高自然叫好，到時不單不會拖累母公司業績，反而帶來額外收益。可是世事豈會盡如人意？叫得做不肖子，營運表現想必不會好到那裡去，價錢賣得差就隨時出現虧損，並且即是在損益表入賬，這時就需要忍受陣痛。不過，母公司沒有了包袱，來年就可以重新上路。</p>
<p>若不想在報表內出現售後虧損，又或者根本賣不出去又怎麼辦？那就向現有股東打主意，將子公司分拆出去。實際操作比較複雜，但原理很簡單，將母公司所持的子公司股票分給其股東。在會計⻆度去看，將子公司分拆給股東其實是分配資產，因此不會出現收益或虧損。再者，為了易於比較，會計準則要求重列報表內去年的數字，將子公司的那部份從經營溢利剔除，這就不露山不顯水把不肖子踢走。</p>
<p>還有一個比較複雜的方法，就是成立Special purpose entity（特殊目的實體，簡稱SPE），然後將子公司轉移給他們。一般來說，SPE通常用作持有金融資產，由無關聯的機構持有，並且按照既定條文運作，若安排得宜，SPE的賬目就不會歸納在母公司的合併報表中，變相將不肖子扔掉。不過，轉移時若出現收益或虧損，就需要在母公司入賬。</p>

<p>推銷說詞:”定期壽險?這沒用啦。時間到了，你沒領到錢，那不是白白浪費嗎?”</p>
<p>破解想法:</p>
<p>請問，你買車時買的安全氣囊、安全帶，為了騎機車或自行車所買的安全帽，你會覺得沒用到，所以是浪費嗎?</p>
<p>這些東西最好不要用到。但萬一發生事情，我們需要它們存在。這就是保險裝置與保險合約的共通意義。</p>
<p>定期壽險為你買到這段期間的保護，這就是有價值的東西。只是這種保障，不像安全帽、安全帶是有形的存在，保險是一種無形的保護。</p>
<p>這些保護最好不要用到。沒用到，不代表它們沒價值。</p>
<p>推銷說詞:”定期壽險?這時間到了你就沒有保障了啊。還是終身好。”</p>
<p>破解想法:</p>
<p>人不是一輩子都需要壽險保障。不需要保障還在花錢買保險，這就像沒在開車，卻買了十個安全氣囊替換模組，沒有騎車，卻買了十頂安全帽。</p>
<p>花錢買沒有必要的保障，這都是浪費。</p>
<p>壽險是被保險者過世後，對於存活的家人的保障。(相關討論可見生命的價值—談死亡保險的用途)。假如被保險者過世，不會對家人形成財務危機，那就沒有壽險的必要。</p>
<p>對於大多人來說，年紀大之後(譬如已經滿60歲了)，小孩已經自立，房貸已經還清，靠著自己的資產也有足夠的生活費來源，這時壽險就沒有存在的必要。</p>
<p>少數在年紀大仍需要壽險的狀況，包括小孩狀況特殊，永遠會依賴你提供生活所需。自己過世後，剩餘資產不足以支應存活配偶的生活。到了60歲，房貸仍沒還完，自己過世會讓家人面對百萬負債。這時壽險或許還有存在的必要。這不是大多人的情形。但是，大多人卻被推銷”終生壽險”。<br>(你可以想想，為什麼?)</p>
<p>推銷說詞:”定期壽險?這種時間一到就會失效的保險，怎會比”永久”有效的終身壽險好呢?”</p>
<p>破解想法:</p>
<p>假如在定期壽險期間，風險真的發生了，家人拿到保險給付。對被保險者來說，這個定期壽險的效期，等同於永久。</p>
<p>重點不是保單效期多久。而是在我們需要壽險的期間，我們有壽險的保障。這樣就可以了。</p>
<p>推銷說詞:”定期壽險?時間到了你一毛都拿不到，不如來個保證還本的壽險吧?”</p>
<p>破解想法:</p>
<p>一定要有的基本體認，壽險是為存活的家人買的，不是為你自己買的。那是一個表現出你的責任，你對家人的愛的方式。</p>
<p>你還在想到期後要拿回錢，這代表你在為自己想，你不是為家人想。這種”還本”的保單，會讓你用高金額買到低保障。真的風險發生時，留下可憐的家人。這是一種”自私”的表現。</p>
<p>為了家人，請直接選用低保費高保額的保單。不要再想，”我能拿到什麼了?”。</p>

<h1 id="Communication"><a href="#Communication" class="headerlink" title="Communication"></a>Communication</h1><h2 id="我们该怎么正确地传达坏消息呢？"><a href="#我们该怎么正确地传达坏消息呢？" class="headerlink" title="我们该怎么正确地传达坏消息呢？"></a>我们该怎么正确地传达坏消息呢？</h2><p>第一步，拿出专业人士的中立姿态。不管是医生对患者说检查结果不好，还是人力资源对求职者说没有录取，尽量在专业的环境里交流。说话清楚有力，眼神直视对方，暗示对方我没做错什么事，只是因为职位、身份，才来告诉你这个消息。</p>
<p>第二步，表达善意，而不是愧疚。我们可以对比一下这两句话，一句是“对不起，这事办砸了”，另一句是“很遗憾，这事没成功”。你会发现，“遗憾”是因为对方会难过，我们从人道主义的角度觉得也不开心，但“对不起”是这件事我也有责任。如果说对不起，对方很容易就抓住话柄，对你进行攻击。</p>
<p>第三步，不提供安慰，但可以陪伴。报告完坏消息后，要是赶紧跑路，也会显得不尊重。所以最好先跟对方一起坐下来，表露出一种态度，那就是我可以一直在这里陪你，回答你的问题。当然，这里说到的传递坏消息的技巧有一个适用范围，就是这件事不是你做错了，你只不过因为身份、职业，不能不去传递这个消息。如果本身就是你的错，那你应该做的第一步就是学会怎么道歉。</p>

<h1 id="Emergency"><a href="#Emergency" class="headerlink" title="Emergency"></a>Emergency</h1><p>如果不幸遇到高空解體的狀況，不論坐在飛機的哪一個部位，生還希望都很渺茫。但即使如此，乘客也要在空中系好安全帶。不然當飛機尚未墜地，在空中翻滾的過程中，乘客就已經在機艙中被來回撞擊而喪命。</p>
<h1 id="Travel"><a href="#Travel" class="headerlink" title="Travel"></a>Travel</h1><h2 id="Flight"><a href="#Flight" class="headerlink" title="Flight"></a>Flight</h2><p>如果你曾乘搭廉航小型客機和大型航空公司的客機的話，可體驗到兩者在飛行平穩度的分別。機型越大和飛得越高就會飛機越平穩，如果你追求更平穩的體驗，建議你選擇與機翼齊平的座位。因為當飛機遇到氣流令機身顛簸的時候，兩頭的座位震盪幅度會比機翼中間位置更大。</p>
<p>最好的睡覺位置在中部左側的靠窗座位，因為在航程中向左邊傾斜的機率更大，而且頭部靠著窗邊睡覺能有更好的承托力，更可以避免在睡夢中被其他乘客叫醒請你站起來讓他去洗手間的機會。</p>
